# Meetup-UnityMP-v1
 Codename: Meetup - Unity Multiplayer - ver. 1 [TEST PROJECT]

This is a project dedicated to learning the new Unity Networking system (Netcode) through primarily by following the Youtube user Dapper Dino's tutorials. Once I finish his series, I plan to build up on this, and use it as a base for future networking based projects.
